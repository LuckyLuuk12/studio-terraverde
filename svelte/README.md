## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

Though be careful here, the cloudflare-adapter likes to generate a stupid `_routes.json` which
should actually be < 100 characters long, but it's not. So you'll need to manually edit it to:

```json
{
	"version": 1,
	"description": "Generated by Luuk",
	"include": [
		"/*"
	],
	"exclude": [
		"/_app/*",
		"/images/*"
	]
}
```

After which you can run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Which then allows you to merge your PRs.
